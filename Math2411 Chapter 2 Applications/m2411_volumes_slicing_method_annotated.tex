\section*{\topic\; Introduction}

Suppose that we want to determine the volume of a 3D region/solid with a varying cross-section such as shown below.

\begin{figure}[h]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.6]{slicing_gr01.jpg}
\caption{3D region/solid with a varying cross-section}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

In this section we will start by dividing the solid into slices along the $x$-axis and then analyze the volume of the slices.

\begin{figure}[h]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.6]{slicing_gr02.jpg}
\caption{3D region/solid divided into three slices}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

The volume of a slice located at $x^{*}_k$ can be estimated as $Vol\big(\,slice_k\,\big)=A(x^{*}_{k})\Delta x$ where $A(x^{*}_{k})$ is the area of a cross-section at point $x^{*}_{k}$. Then, if there are $n$ total slices we have
\[\text{Total Volume}\approx\ds\sum^{n}_{k=1}Vol\Big(\,slice_k\,\Big)=\ds\sum^{n}_{k=1}A(x^{*}_{k})\Delta x.\]
As the number of slices increases, the width of the slices decreases and we can calculate the total volume as an integral.
\[Volume=\stackrel{\stackrel{\text{\textcolor{red}{Sum}}}{\downarrow}}{\int^{x=b}_{x=a}}\;\underbrace{\stackrel{\stackrel{\text{\textcolor{red}{\;Cross-Section Area\;}}}{\downarrow}}{A(x)}\;\;\stackrel{\stackrel{\text{\textcolor{red}{\;Width of Slice\;}}}{\downarrow}}{dx}}_{\text{\textcolor{blue}{Volume of Slice}}}\] 

We will focus on solids formed by revolving regions in the $(x,y)$-plane about a coordinate axis.

\section*{Solids of Revolution}

Start with a region below the graph $y=f(x)$ and revolve around the $x$-axis.

\begin{figure}[h]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{slicing_gr03.jpg}$\Longrightarrow$\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{slicing_gr04.jpg}$\Longrightarrow$\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{slicing_gr05.jpg}
\caption{Creating a solid of revolution}
\end{center}
\end{figure}


\subsection*{The Disc Method:}

Start with a concrete example.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\vskip 2mm

\begin{example} Find the volume of the solid of revolution formed by rotating the region below $y=(x-1)^2+1$ on the interval $[-1,3]$ about the $x$-axis. 
\vskip 5mm
Start by graphing the region.

\begin{figure}[h]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.6]{slicing_gr06.jpg}$\xRightarrow[\text{\textcolor{red}{Create solid of revolution}}]{}$\includegraphics[scale=0.6]{slicing_gr07.jpg}
\caption{Solid of revolution created from a region below $y=(x-1)^2+1$}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

We now analyze the volume of a slice of the region.

\vfill\eject

\begin{figure}[h]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.6]{slicing_gr08.jpg}$\xRightarrow[\stackrel{\text{\textcolor{red}{Creating a Slice of the Region}}}{\text{\textcolor{red}{\tiny By Revolving a Rectangle}}}]{}$\includegraphics[scale=0.6]{slicing_gr09.jpg}
\caption{The slices of the 3D solid are circular discs}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

The cross-sectional area of a circular disc located at $x$ is $A(x)=\pi\big[f(x)\big]^2$. So we evaluate the following integral.

\beq
Volume&=&\pi\ds\int^{x=b}_{x=a}\big[f(x)\big]^2\,dx\\
\\
&=&\pi\ds\int^{x=3}_{x=-1}\big[(x-1)^2+1\big]^2\,dx\\
\\
&=&\pi\ds\int^{x=3}_{x=-1}(x-1)^4+2(x-1)^2+1\,dx\\
\\
&=&\pi\left[\ds\frac{(x-1)^5}{5}+\ds\frac{2}{3}(x-1)^3+x\ds\right]^{x=3}_{x=-1}\\
\\
&=&\pi\left[\left(\ds\frac{2^5}{5}+\ds\frac{2}{3}\cdot 2^3+3\right)-\left(\ds\frac{(-2)^5}{5}+\ds\frac{2}{3}\cdot(-2)^3-1\right)\right]\\
\\
&=&\ds\frac{412}{15}\pi
\eeq  

\end{example}

Now try an example on your own.

\subsection*{The Washer Method:}

Sometimes the slices will not be discs. Consider the following example where we rotate the region between $y=\sqrt{x}$ and $y=1$ on the interval $[1,4]$ about the $x$-axis.

\begin{minipage}[]{6.5in}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.7]{slicing_gr14.jpg}$\xRightarrow[\text{\textcolor{red}{Create solid of revolution}}]{}$\includegraphics[scale=0.7]{slicing_gr15.jpg}
\captionof{figure}{Rotate the region between $y=\sqrt{x}$ and $y=1$ on the interval $[1,4]$.}
\label{fig:}
\end{center}
\end{minipage}
\vskip 5mm
Look at the slices of the solid. They are not discs.
\vskip 5mm
\begin{minipage}[]{6.5in}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.7]{slicing_gr16.jpg}$\xRightarrow[\stackrel{\text{\textcolor{red}{Creating a slice of the}}}{\text{\textcolor{red}{\tiny 3D solid of revolution}}}]{}$\includegraphics[scale=0.7]{slicing_gr17.jpg}
\captionof{figure}{Slices after rotating the region between $y=\sqrt{x}$ and $y=1$ on the interval $[1,4]$.}
\label{fig:}
\end{center}
\end{minipage}
\vspace*{2mm} 

The slices are ``washers." Fortunately, the cross-sectional area of a washer is easy. 
\[A(x)=\pi\big[R(x)\big]^2-\pi\big[r(x)\big]^2=\pi\left(\big[R(x)\big]^2-\big[r(x)\big]^2\right),\]
where $R(x)$ is the larger radius to the outside edge of the washer, and $r(x)$ is the smaller radius to the inside edge of the washer. And so we simply evaluate the following integral.

\[Volume=\pi\ds\int^{x=b}_{x=a}\big[R(x)\big]^2-\big[r(x)\big]^2\,dx\]

Now try another example on your own. Be careful with the cross-sectional area.

The slices of the region are circular washers. The cross-section area of a washer located at point $x$ is $\pi\big[R(x)\big]^2-\pi\big[r(x)\big]^2$, where $R(x)$ is the larger radius to the outside edge of the washer, and $r(x)$ is the smaller radius to the inside edge of the washer. And so we simply evaluate the following integral.
\beq
Volume&=&\pi\ds\int^{x=b}_{x=a}\big[R(x)\big]^2-\big[r(x)\big]^2\,dx\\
\\
&=&\pi\ds\int^{x=4}_{x=1}x^2-\left(\ds\frac{1}{x}\right)^2\,dx\\

\begin{example}
We can rotate a regions about the $y$-axis as well. Suppose we have the region under $y=4-x^2$ on the interval $[0,2]$ about the $y$-axis. Since we rotate about the $y$-axis we should probably switch variables to have $x=\sqrt{4-y}$.

The slices are discs and so $A(y)=\pi\big[r(y)\big]^2=\pi\big[\sqrt{4-y}\big]^2$. And so we simply evaluate the following integral.

&=&\pi\ds\int^{y=4}_{y=0}4-y\,dy\\
