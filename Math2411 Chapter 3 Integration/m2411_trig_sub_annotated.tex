\section*{\topic\; Introduction:}

Our objective is to integrate function involving square roots of differences and sums of squares.
\[\sqrt{a^2-x^2}\qquad\sqrt{x^2-a^2}\qquad\sqrt{x^2+a^2}\]
\vskip 5mm
We will need a few basic trig identities.
\beq
\sin^2(x)+\cos^2(x)=1&&\sin(2x)=\sin^2(x)=\ds\frac{1-\cos(2x)}{2}\\
\cos^2(x)=\ds\frac{1+\cos(2x)}{2}&&\tan^2(x)=\sec^2(x)-1
\eeq

\section*{Integrals involving $\sqrt{a^2-x^2}$:}

Let’s consider an example together. The general strategy is to make a substitution $x=a\sin(\theta)$.

Then our square root quantity is converted into a simple trig function. Here is a right triangle for reference.

\section*{Integrals involving $\sqrt{x^2+a^2}$:}

Let's consider integrals with a term $\sqrt{x^2+a^2}$. We let $x=a\tan(\theta)$ and build a reference triangle.
\vskip 2mm

\vskip 2mm
We can use the following problem solving strategy.

\begin{example} Calculate the length of the curve $y=x^2$ on the interval $[0,1/2]$. Our arclength formula gives us
\[s=\ds\int^{x=b}_{x=a}\sqrt{1+\big[f'(x)\big]^2}\,dx=\ds\int^{x=1/2}_{x=0}\sqrt{1+4x^2}\,dx.\]
This looks like a tricky integral since there is no obvious $u$-substitution. We try a trig-sub.
We let $x=\frac{1}{2}\tan(\theta)$ so that $dx=\frac{1}{2}\sec^2(\theta)\,d\theta$. Now continue on your own.
\vskip 5mm
\note Notice that the quantity $\sqrt{1+4x^2}$ suggests a reference triangle with leg lengths of $1$ and $2x$ giving a hypotenuse with length of $\sqrt{1+4x^2}$. Build your own reference triangle.

\section*{Integrals involving $\sqrt{x^2-a^2}$:}


\begin{example} Evaluate the integral $\ds\int^{x=5}_{x=3}\sqrt{x^2-9}\,dx$.
\vskip 5mm
The geometry suggests we let $x=3\sec(\theta)$ and so then have $dx=3\sec(\theta)\tan(\theta)\,d\theta$.
\vskip 5mm
\begin{minipage}[]{6.5in}

\end{center}
\end{minipage}

\vskip 5mm

Notice there are different reference triangles depending on whether the $x$-values are positive (so we have  $x>a$) or negative (so we have $x<-a$). The main consequences is when $x$ is positive we have $\sqrt{x^2-a^2}=a\tan(\theta)$. When $x$ is negative we have $\sqrt{x^2-a^2}=-a\tan(\theta)$.
