\section*{\topic\; Introduction:}

Our objective is to integrate function involving of products and powers of $\sin(x)$ and $\cos(x)$, or products and powers of $\sec(x)$ and $\tan(x)$  
\vskip 5mm
We will need a few basic trig identities.
\beq
\sin^2(x)+\cos^2(x)=1&&\sin(2x)=2\sin(x)\cos(x)\\
\cos^2(x)=\ds\frac{1+\cos(2x)}{2}&&\tan^2(x)=\sec^2(x)-1\\
\sin^2(x)=\ds\frac{1-\cos(2x)}{2}&&\\
\eeq

\section*{Integrals Involving $\sin^{k}(x)$ and $\cos^{j}(x)$:}

Let’s consider a simple example together.
\vskip 2mm


\begin{minipage}[]{6.5in}
%\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.8]{trig_integrals_gr1.jpg}
%\captionof{figure}{}
\label{fig:}
%\end{center}
\end{minipage}

Notice this is just a basic $u$-substitution problem. Let's consider another more complicated example.
 
\vfill\eject


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


\begin{example} Integrating $\ds\int\cos^j(x)\sin^k(x)\,dx$ when $j$ or $k$ is odd. As a concrete example, evaluate the integral 
\[\ds\int\cos^2(x)\sin^3(x)\,dx\]

\begin{minipage}[]{6.5in}
%\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.7]{trig_integrals_gr2.jpg}
%\captionof{figure}{}
\label{fig:}
%\end{center}
\end{minipage}

Notice after the first step the $\sin(x)\,dx$ looks like $du$ in a $u$-substitution, so this leads us to write all other trig functions in terms of $\cos(x)$.
\[\ds\int\cos^2(x)\sin^2(x)\stackrel{\stackrel{\stackrel{\text{\textcolor{red}{Wants to be our $du$}}}{\text{\textcolor{red}{term in a $u$-sub}}}}{\downarrow}}{\big[\sin(x)\,dx\big]}\quad\xRightarrow[\stackrel{\text{\textcolor{red}{Natural choice}}}{\text{\textcolor{red}{for our $u$-sub}}}]{}\quad u=\cos(x)\quad\xRightarrow[\stackrel{\text{\textcolor{red}{We have a}}}{\text{\textcolor{red}{perfect match}}}]{}\quad -du=\sin(x)\,dx\]

\noindent{\bf\emph{\underline{Observation}:}} If the exponent over $\sin(x)$ is odd we can ``attach" one of the $\sin(x)$ terms to the differential $dx$ and prepare for a $u$-substitution. Let's set up another example.

\end{example}

\begin{example} Evaluate the following integral.

\[\ds\int\cos^3(x)\sin^5(x)\,dx\]
