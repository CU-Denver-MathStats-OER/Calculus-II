\section*{\topic\; Introduction:}

Our objective is to estimate integrals rather than evaluate them directly using antiderivatives. The antiderivatives of many functions either cannot be expressed or cannot be expressed easily in closed form (that is, in terms of known functions). Consequently, rather than evaluate definite integrals of these functions directly, we can use certain techniques to approximate their values. This is known as {\bf\emph{numerical integration}}. In this section we explore several of these
techniques.

\section*{The Midpoint Rule:}

When we first studied definite integrals we used Riemann sums as an initial estimation for the area between the graph of a function and the $x$-axis. One type of Riemann sum we used is a {\bf\emph{Midpoint Riemann Sum}}.

\begin{minipage}[]{6.5in}

\includegraphics[scale=0.6]{midpointsum.jpg}
\captionof{figure}{Midpoint Riemann Sum Estimation of Area}
\label{fig:midpointsum}
\end{center}
\end{minipage}
\vskip 5mm
Then we would have
\[\ds\int^{x=b}_{x=a}f(x)\,dx\approx f(m_1)\cdot\Delta x+f(m_2)\cdot\Delta x f(m_3)\cdot\Delta x+f(m_4)\cdot\Delta x,\;\text{where }\Delta x=(b-a)/4.\]

Let’s consider an example together.

There are other techniques besides the midpoint rule.

\section*{The Trapezoid Rule:}

One observation about the midpoint rule is that the top of the rectangles do not match the graph of the function very well which might create large errors. One attempt to fix this is to use trapezoids instead of rectangles.
\vskip 5mm
\begin{minipage}[]{6.5in}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[trim= 0mm 0cm 0cm 0cm, clip=true, scale=0.6]{trapezoids.jpg}
\captionof{figure}{Trapezoid Estimation of Area}
\label{fig:trapezoids}
\end{center}
\end{minipage}
\vskip 1cm
So we have $\ds\int^{x=b}_{x=a}f(x)\,dx\approx\ds\sum^{n}_{k=1}Area\big(\,Trapezoid_{_k}\,\big)$.

\ifnum\longform=1
\vfill\eject
	\else
\vskip 5mm
\fi

Fortunately, the area of a trapezoid is very easy to compute. If a trapezoid has two heights $h_1$ and $h_2$ a base with length $b$, then 
\[Area\big(\,Trapezoid\,\big)=\ds\frac{b}{2}\big(h_1+h_2\big).\]
This means we have
\beq
\ds\sum^{n}_{k=1}Area\big(\,Trapezoid_{_k}\,\big)&=&\ds\frac{\Delta x}{2}\Big(\,f(x_0)+f(x_1)\Big)+\ds\frac{\Delta x}{2}\Big(\,f(x_1)+f(x_2)\Big)+\cdots\ds\frac{\Delta x}{2}\Big(\,f(x_{n-1})+f(x_n)\Big)\\
&=&\ds\frac{\Delta x}{2}\Big(f(x_0)+\underbrace{f(x_1)+f(x_1)}_{\textcolor{red}{2f(x_1)}}+\underbrace{f(x_2)+f(x_2)}_{\textcolor{red}{2f(x_2)}}+\cdots+\underbrace{f(x_{n-1}+f(x_{n-1})}_{\textcolor{red}{2f(x_{n-1})}}+f(x_n)\Big)
\eeq

\end{minipage}
\vskip 5mm
\begin{discussion}
\vspace*{2mm}
Before we work any examples, we should observe that
\[T_n=\ds\frac{1}{2}\Big(L_n+R_n\Big)\]
where $L_n$ is a left Riemann sum and $R_n$ is a right Riemann sum. Moreover, the trapezoidal rule tends to
overestimate the value of a definite integral over intervals where the function is concave up and to
underestimate the value of a definite integral over intervals where the function is concave down. On the other
hand, the midpoint rule tends to average out these errors somewhat by partially overestimating and partially underestimating
the value of the definite integral over these same types of intervals. This leads us to hypothesize that, in general, the
midpoint rule tends to be more accurate than the trapezoidal rule. In fact, as we will see later, the theoretical upper bound for error with the midpoint rule $M_n$ is one half the theoretical upper bound for the error with a trapezoid rule $T_n$.

\vspace*{2mm}
We might have been tempted to round $8.24$ down and choose $n=8$, but this would be incorrect because we
must have an integer greater than or equal to $8.24$. We need to keep in mind that the error estimates provide an
upper bound only for the error. The actual estimate may, in fact, be a much better approximation than is indicated
by the error bound.

\noindent{\bf\emph{\underline{Question}:}} Can you think of an issue that we have with both the Midpoint Rule and Trapezoid Rule approximations?
\vskip 1.3in

\noindent{\bf\emph{\underline{Answer}:}} We are approximating curved graphs using straight lines having zero curvature. With the midpoint rule, we estimated areas of regions under curves by using rectangles. In a sense, we approximated the curve with piecewise constant functions. With the trapezoidal rule, we approximated the curve by using piecewise linear functions.

\section*{Simpson's Rule:}

What if we used piecewise quadratic functions. That is, on subintervals of $[a,b]$ use the graph of a quadratic function (meaning a parabola) to approximate the graph $y=f(x)$. This technique is known as {\bf\emph{Simpson's Rule}}.
\vskip 1mm
\note In order to make this process work we need an even number of subintervals and we use the endpoints of two adjacent intervals to build our parabolas as seen in Figure \ref{fig:simpsons} provided below.

So what about the theoretical error for Simpson's Rule? Our geometric intuition suggests it should be much smaller for the same number of subintervals.

\ssol In this problem we have $n=6$, $n^4=1296$, and $(b-a)^5=3^5=243$. Next we have $f'(x)=x/\sqrt{1+x^2}$ which has a maximum value $M=4/\sqrt{17}\approx 0.970143$ at $x=4$. Then we have
\[\text{Error in }S_6\le\ds\frac{M(b-a)^5}{180n^4}=\ds\frac{4}{\sqrt{17}}\cdot\ds\frac{243}{180\cdot 1296}=0.00101057.\] 
Our approximation using $S_6$ is within two decimal places of accuracy. If we were to use $M_6$ our theoretical error bound would be
\[\text{Error in }M_6=\ds\frac{M(b-a)^3}{24n^2}=\ds\frac{4}{\sqrt{17}}\cdot\ds\frac{27}{24\cdot 36}=0.0058678.\]
As you can see, the theoretical error bound is improved with Simpson's Rule.
\vskip 2mm
\note Just because the error bound for $S_6$ is smaller than the error bound for $M_6$ {\bf\emph{DOES NOT}} mean that $S_6$ give a better approximation for this integral
