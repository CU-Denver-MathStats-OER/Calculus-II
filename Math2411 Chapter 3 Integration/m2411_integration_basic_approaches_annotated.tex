\section*{\topic:}

We are looking at some basic approaches to integration used when a function does not exactly match one of our known formulas. Often the strategy is to use identities and/or manipulate the integrand algebraically so that it fits into a know form. We will work through a number of examples below.

\section*{Integration Examples:}

Let’s work an example together.

\begin{example}

Evaluate the integral $\ds\int\cos^2(x)\,dx$
\vskip 5mm
\noindent{\bf\emph{\underline{Workspace}:}}
\vfill\eject

\ifnum\longform=1
	\begin{boxsolution}
\vspace*{5mm}
We integrate as follows.

\beq
\ds\int\cos^2(x)\,dx&=&\ds\frac{1}{2}\ds\int 1+\cos(2x)\,dx\\
&=&\ds\frac{1}{2}\left(\;x+\ds\frac{1}{2}\sin(2x)\;\right)+C\\
&=&\ds\frac{1}{2}x+\ds\frac{1}{4}\sin(2x)+C
\eeq
