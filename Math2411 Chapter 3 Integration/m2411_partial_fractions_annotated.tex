\section*{\topic\, Introduction:}

Our objective is to integrate rational functions where $u$-sub or algebraic manipulations are not helpful or clear. Let's look at some examples. 
\vskip 5mm
\[\int\ds\frac{x^2+4x-1}{x^3+6x^2-3x+7}\,dx\qquad\int\ds\frac{2}{x^2+4x+8}\,dx\]
The first integral can be solved using $u$-substitution letting $u=x^3+6x^2-3x+7$ so that $du=\left(3x^2+12x-3\right)\,dx$. We then have
\beq
\int\ds\frac{x^2+4x-1}{x^3+6x^2-3x+7}\,dx&=&\ds\frac{1}{3}\int\ds\frac{3\big(x^2+4x-1\big)}{x^3+6x^2-3x+7}\,dx\\
&=&\ds\frac{1}{3}\int\ds\frac{3x^2+12x-3}{x^3+6x^2-3x+7}\,dx\\
&=&\ds\frac{1}{3}\ds\int\ds\frac{du}{u}\\
&=&\ds\frac{1}{3}\ln|u|+C\\
&=&\ds\frac{1}{3}\ln\left|x^3+6x^2-3x+7\right|+C
\eeq

The second integral can be solved by algebraic manipulations, a $u$-sub, and a known antiderivative.
\beq
\int\ds\frac{2}{x^2+4x+8}\,dx&=&\int\ds\frac{2}{x^2+4x+4+4}\,dx\\
&=&\int\ds\frac{2}{(x+2)^2+4}\,dx\\
&=&\ds\int\ds\frac{2}{u^2+4}\,du\qquad\text{(Letting }u=x+2)\\
&=&\tan^{-1}(u/2)+C\\
&=&\tan^{-1}\left(\ds\frac{x+2}{2}\right)+C
\eeq

But some integrals of rational expressions resist any $u$-sub or algebraic manipulations. For example,
\[\ds\int\ds\frac{2x+5}{x^2+4x-5}\,dx.\]

\vfill\eject

We can not turn this into a log-form by $u$-substitution since with $u=x^2+4x-5$ we have $du=\left(2x+4\right)\,dx$ and the numerator is not a scalar multiple of the denominator.

\vskip 5mm

So we split up the integral.
\[\ds\int\ds\frac{2x+5}{x^2+4x-5}\,dx=\ds\int\ds\frac{2x+4}{x^2+4x-5}\,dx+\ds\int\ds\frac{1}{x^2+4x-5}\,dx\]
The first integral is a simple $u$-substitution. But what about the second integral. We could try to complete the square as follows.
\beq
\ds\int\ds\frac{1}{x^2+4x-5}\,dx&=&\ds\int\ds\frac{1}{x^2+4x-4-1}\,dx\\
&=&\ds\int\ds\frac{1}{(x-2)^2-1}\,dx\\
&=&\ds\int\ds\frac{1}{u^2-1}\,du\qquad\text{(Letting }u=x-2)
\eeq
But the new integral is not in a familiar form. So it looks like we need a new strategy. We will use the following algebraic fact. It is a good exercise to check this equality.
\[\ds\frac{2x+5}{x^2+4x-5}=\ds\frac{7}{6(x-1)}+\ds\frac{5}{6(x+5)}\]
Now we have the following.
\beq
\ds\int\ds\frac{2x+5}{x^2+4x-5}\,dx&=&\ds\int\ds\frac{7}{6(x-1)}+\ds\frac{5}{6(x+5)}\,dx\\
&=&\ds\frac{7}{6}\ds\int\ds\frac{1}{x-1}\,dx+\ds\frac{5}{6}\ds\int\ds\frac{1}{x+5}\,dx\\
&=&\ds\frac{7}{6}\ln|x-1|+\ds\frac{5}{6}\ln|x+5|+C\\
\eeq
So if we can break apart a complicated rational expression into a sum of simpler rational expressions, often the new expressions will be easier to handle as far as integration.

\section*{Partial Fractions Method}

Let's see how the previous fraction was decomposed into simpler fractions. 
\vskip 5mm

\noindent{\bf\emph{Step \#1}:} Factor the denominator.
\[x^2+4x-5=(x-1)(x+5)\]
Do you notice anything about these factors?
\vskip 1.5cm

\noindent{\bf\emph{Step \#2}:} Try to break up the fraction so that the parts correspond to the factors.
\[\ds\frac{2x+5}{x^2+4x-5}=\ds\frac{2x+5}{(x-1)(x+5)}=\ds\frac{A}{x-1}+\ds\frac{B}{x+5}\]

\vskip 5mm

\noindent{\bf\emph{Step \#3}:} Solve for $A$ and $B$. That is, find values of $A$ and $B$ that satisfy the previous equality. This is the crux of the process. We start by combining terms on the RHS and then seeting numerators equal.
\[\ds\frac{2x+5}{(x-1)(x+5)}=\ds\frac{A(x+5)+B(x-1)}{(x-1)(x+5)}\quad\xRightarrow[\stackrel{\text{\textcolor{red}{Set Numerators}}}{\text{\tiny\textcolor{red}{Equal}}}]{}\quad 2x+5=A(x+5)+B(x-1)\]
\vskip 5mm
Methods to solve for $A$ and $B$:
\begin{itemize}
\item[$\bullet$] {\bf\emph{\underline{Method of Strategic Substitution}:}} Set $x=1$ and substitute to get
\[7=6A\quad\Longrightarrow\quad A=7/6.\]
Next set $x=-5$ and substitute to get
\[-5=-6B\quad\Longrightarrow\quad B=5/6.\]
So we have
\[\ds\frac{2x+5}{x^2+4x-5}=\ds\frac{A}{x-1}+\ds\frac{B}{x+5}=\ds\frac{7}{6(x-1)}+\ds\frac{5}{6(x+5)}.\]

\vskip 1cm

\item[$\bullet$] {\bf\emph{\underline{Method of Equating Coefficients}:}} Expand both sides and equate coefficients.
\[2x+5=(A+B)x+(5B-A)\]
We see that
\beq
A+B&=&2\\
5A-B&=&1\\
\eeq
Solving this system of equations gives us $A=7/6$ and $B=5/6$.
So we have
\[\ds\frac{2x+5}{x^2+4x-5}=\ds\frac{A}{x-1}+\ds\frac{B}{x+5}=\ds\frac{7}{6(x-1)}+\ds\frac{5}{6(x+5)}.\]

\end{itemize}

The partial fractions decomposition is an algebraic technique to simplify an integral. There is no calculus involved in the partial fractions.

Let's work an example on your own.

\section*{Partial Fractions Examples}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


\begin{example} Evaluate $\ds\int\ds\frac{x+3}{x^3-x^2-2x}\,dx$

\ifnum\longform=1
	\begin{boxsolution}
\vspace*{5mm}
We start by factoring the denominator and breaking apart to get
{\small
\[\ds\frac{x+3}{x^3-x^2-2x}=\ds\frac{x+3}{x(x-2)(x+1)}=\ds\frac{A}{x}+\ds\frac{B}{x-2}+\ds\frac{C}{x+1}=\ds\frac{A(x+1)(x-2)+Bx(x+1)+Cx(x-2)}{x(x-2)(x+1)}\]
}
After putting the pieces back together we get
\[\xRightarrow[\stackrel{\text{\textcolor{red}{Set Numerators}}}{\text{\tiny\textcolor{red}{Equal}}}]{}\quad x+3=A(x+1)(x-2)+Bx(x+1)+Cx(x-2)\quad\text{\textcolor{red}{(Eqn. 3.8)}}\]
We now solve equation 3.8 for $A$, $B$, and $C$ using one of our described methods.

Now we're ready for the integral.

\ds\int\ds\frac{x+3}{x^3-x^2-2x}\,dx&=&-\ds\int\ds\frac{1}{x}\,dx+\ds\frac{4}{3}\ds\int\ds\frac{1}{x-2}\,dx-\ds\frac{1}{3}\ds\int\ds\frac{1}{x+1}\,dx\\
\\

\eeq

\end{example}

Let's work another example together.
\vskip 5mm


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


\begin{example} Evaluate $\ds\int\ds\frac{x-2}{(2x-1)^2(x-1)}\,dx$
\vskip 5mm

\noindent{\bf\emph{\underline{Workspace}:}} 

\vfill\eject

\ifnum\longform=1
	\begin{boxsolution}
\vspace*{5mm}
The denominator is already factored. Then we notice that the factor $(2x-1)$ is a repeated factor. In fact it's repeated twice and so this factor gives us two pieces, one for each power, as follows.
\[\ds\frac{x-2}{(2x-1)^2(x-1)}=\underbrace{\ds\frac{A}{2x-1}+\ds\frac{B}{(2x-1)^2}}_{\stackrel{\text{\textcolor{red}{Repeated factors require}}}{\text{\tiny\textcolor{red}{multiple components}}}}+\ds\frac{C}{x-1}=\ds\frac{A(2x-1)(x-1)+B(x-1)+C(2x-1)^2}{(2x-1)^2(x-1)}\]
After putting the pieces back together we can solve an equation.
\[\xRightarrow[\stackrel{\text{\textcolor{red}{Set Numerators}}}{\text{\tiny\textcolor{red}{Equal}}}]{}\quad x-2=A(2x-1)(x-1)+B(x-1)+C(2x-1)^2\]
We now solve the equation for $A$, $B$, and $C$ using one of our described methods. Equating coefficients we get $A=2$, $B=3$, $C=-1$. Then we have
\beq
\ds\int\ds\frac{x-2}{(2x-1)^2(x-1)}\,dx&=&2\ds\int\ds\frac{1}{2x-1}\,dx+3\ds\int\ds\frac{1}{(2x-1)^2}\,dx-\ds\int\ds\frac{1}{x-1}\,dx\\
&=&\ln|2x-1|-\ds\frac{3}{2(2x-1)}-\ln|x-1|+C
\eeq

	\begin{boxsolution}
\vspace*{5mm}
The denominator needs to be factored. 
\[x^3+x=x(x^2+1)\]
Then we notice that the factor $(x^2+1)$ is a quadratic factor. Looking at the previous table, item c., we break apart as follows.
\[\ds\frac{2x-3}{x^3+x}=\ds\frac{2x-3}{x(x^2+1)}=\underbrace{\ds\frac{Ax+B}{x^2+1}}_{\stackrel{\text{\textcolor{red}{Quadratic factors require}}}{\text{\tiny\textcolor{red}{Linear Numerator}}}}+\ds\frac{C}{x}=\ds\frac{(Ax+B)x+C(x^2+1)}{x(x^2+1)}\]
After putting the pieces back together we can solve an equation.
\[\xRightarrow[\stackrel{\text{\textcolor{red}{Set Numerators}}}{\text{\tiny\textcolor{red}{Equal}}}]{}\quad 2x-3=(Ax+B)x+C(x^2+1)\]
We now solve the equation for $A$, $B$, and $C$ using one of our described methods. Equating coefficients we get $A=3$, $B=2$, $C=-3$. Then we have
\beq
\ds\int\ds\frac{2x-3}{x^3+x}\,dx&=&\ds\int\ds\frac{3x+2}{x^2+1}\,dx-3\ds\int\ds\frac{1}{x}\,dx\\
&=&\ds\frac{3}{2}\underbrace{\ds\int\ds\frac{2x}{x^2+1}\,dx}_{\stackrel{\text{\textcolor{red}{This is a}}}{\text{\tiny\textcolor{red}{Log-Form}}}}+2\underbrace{\ds\int\ds\frac{1}{x^2+1}\,dx}_{\stackrel{\text{\textcolor{red}{Arctangent}}}{\text{\tiny\textcolor{red}{Form}}}}-3\underbrace{\ds\int\ds\frac{1}{x}\,dx}_{\stackrel{\text{\textcolor{red}{Log}}}{\text{\tiny\textcolor{red}{Form}}}}\\
&=&\ds\frac{3}{2}\ln(x^2+1)+2\tan^{-1}(x)-3\ln|x|+C\\
