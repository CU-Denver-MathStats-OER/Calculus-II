In our guided lecture notes we considered the infinite series
\[\ds\sum^{\infty}_{n=0}(-1)^{n+1}\ds\frac{\big(n!\big)^2}{(2n)!}.\]
We showed the series converges by the Ratio Test but we also wanted to try the Alternating Series Test. The question is how to evaluate the limit
\[\ds\lim_{n\to\infty}\ds\frac{\big(n!\big)^2}{(2n!)}\]
without using the heavy machinery of Stirling's approximation $n!\approx\sqrt{2\pi n}\left(\frac{e}{n}\right)^n$?

Instead we will use Bernoulli's Inequality.

\begin{theorem}[Bernoulli] Let $x\ge -1$ be a real number and $r$ be any non-negative real number. Then we satisfy the following inequalities.
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item If $r\ge 1$, then $(1+x)^r\ge 1+rx$.
		\item If $0\le r\le 1$, then $(1+x)^r\le 1+rx$.
	\end{enumerate}

\end{theorem} 

To evaluate the limit we will consider the sequence $a_n=(2n)!/(n!)^2$ and first observe that
\[\ds\frac{(2n)!}{\big(n!\big)^2}=\ds\frac{(2n)(2n-1)(2n-2)!}{n^2\cdot\big[(n-1)!\big]^2}=4\left(1-\ds\frac{1}{2n}\right)\ds\frac{\big[2(n-1)\big]!}{\big[(n-1)!\big]\big)^2}\]
From this and an induction argument we see that
\beq
\ds\frac{(2n)!}{\big(n!\big)^2}&=&4^n\ds\prod^{n-1}_{k=0}\left(1-\ds\frac{1}{2k+2}\right)\\
&=&\ds\frac{4^n}{2}\ds\prod^{n-1}_{k=1}\left(1-\ds\frac{1}{2k+2}\,\right)\\
&=&\ds\frac{4^n}{2}\ds\prod^{n-1}_{k=1}\left(1-\ds\frac{1}{2}\left(\ds\frac{1}{k+1}\right)\,\right)\\
&\ge&\ds\frac{4^n}{2}\ds\prod^{n-1}_{k=1}\left(1-\ds\frac{1}{k+1}\,\right)^{1/2}\quad\text{By Bernoulli's Inequality}\\
&=&\ds\frac{4^n}{2\sqrt{n}}
\eeq
So we have the following inequalities.
\[\ds\frac{(2n)!}{\big(n!\big)^2}\ge \ds\frac{4^n}{2\sqrt{n}}\quad\Longrightarrow\quad 0\le\ds\frac{\big(n!\big)^2}{(2n)!}\le \ds\frac{2\sqrt{n}}{4^n}. \]
Now since $\ds\lim_{n\to\infty}\ds\frac{2\sqrt{n}}{4^n}=0$, we have by the Squeeze Theorem that $\ds\lim_{n\to\infty}\ds\frac{\big(n!\big)^2}{(2n)!}=0$.
