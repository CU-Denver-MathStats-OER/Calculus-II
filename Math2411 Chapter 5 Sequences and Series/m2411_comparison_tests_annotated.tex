\section*{\topic\, Introduction:}

Our objective is to study the comparison tests for convergence of infinite series. Let's motivate with an example.
\[\ds\sum^{\infty}_{n=1}\ds\frac{1}{n^3+3n+1}\]
We might consider the Integral Test since $f(x)=\frac{1}{x^3+3x+1}$ satisfies all three properties for the Integral Test: $f$ is continuous for all $x|ge 1$; $f(x)>0$ for all $x>1$; and $f$ is decreasing for all $x>1$. However, the integral 
\[\ds\int^{\infty}_{x=1}\ds\frac{1}{x^3+3x+1}\,dx\]
is a difficult integral. The obvious technique of choice would be partial fractions, but the denominator $x^3+3x+1$ is difficult to factor. In fact, it factors into the product of a linear factor and an irreducible quadratic where the one real zero is
\[x=-\left(\ds\frac{2}{\sqrt{5}-1}\right)^{1/3}+\left(\ds\frac{\sqrt{5}-1}{2}\right)^{1/3}.\] 
Since we can rarely determine the exact value of an infinite series we are often satisfied by simply determining convergence or divergence. And if the series converges, we can estimate the value of the sum with partial sums.

\section*{Limit Comparison Test:}

Let's consider the following example.
\[\ds\sum^{\infty}_{n=2}\ds\frac{1}{n^2-3}\]
Our obvious direct comparison series is $\sum^{\infty}_{n=2}\frac{1}{n^2}$ which is a convergent $p$-series with $p=2$. However,
\[\ds\frac{1}{n^2-3}>\ds\frac{1}{n^2}\]
for all $n\ge 2$ and so our direct comparison is inconclusive. But it would be convenient to be able to use our knowledge about the convergence of $\sum^{\infty}_{n=2}\frac{1}{n^2}$. Fortunately, there is another comparison test.

\includegraphics[scale=0.7]{limit_comparison_thm.jpg}

\end{minipage}

\vskip 5mm

In our current example we have $a_n=1/(n^2-2)$ and $b_n=1/n^2$. Then we have
\[L=\ds\lim_{n\to\infty}\ds\frac{a_n}{b_n}=\ds\lim_{n\to\infty}\ds\frac{1/(n^2-2)}{1/n^2}=\ds\lim_{n\to\infty}\ds\frac{n^2}{n^2-2}=1.\]
Since $L>0$ and $\sum^{\infty}_{n=2}\frac{1}{n^2}$ is a convergent $p$-series we conclude that $\sum^{\infty}_{n=2}\frac{1}{n^2-3}$ converges by the Limit Comparison Test.

We compare $\ds\sum^{\infty}_{n=1}\ds\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}+1}$ with $\ds\sum^{\infty}_{n=1}\ds\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}$ which is the divergent $p$-series. But Direct comparison is inconclusive since for all positive $n$ we have
\[\ds\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}+1}<\ds\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}.\]
Let's use the Limit Comparison Test with $a_n=1/(\sqrt{n}+1)$ and $b_n=1/\sqrt{n}$ and set up $\lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{a_n}{b_n}$.

\[\ds\frac{2^n+1}{3^n}>\left(\ds\frac{2}{3}\right)^n.\]
Let's use the Limit Comparison Test with $a_n=(2^n+1)/3^n$ and $b_n=$ and set up $\lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{a_n}{b_n}$.

Noticing that $n>\ln(n)$ for sufficiently large $n$, we compare $\ds\sum^{\infty}_{n=1}\ds\frac{\ln(n)}{n^2}$ with $\ds\sum^{\infty}_{n=1}\ds\frac{1}{n}$ which is the divergent Harmonic series. But Direct comparison is inconclusive since for all positive $n$ we have

Let's use the Limit Comparison Test with $a_n=\ln(n)/n^2$ and $b_n=$ and set up $\lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{a_n}{b_n}$.

We can see from this last example that sometime the comparison series is not obvious at first glance and some experimentation is required to find a series where comparison will be conclusive. This ends the notes on the Direct Comparison Test and the Limit Comparison Test.
