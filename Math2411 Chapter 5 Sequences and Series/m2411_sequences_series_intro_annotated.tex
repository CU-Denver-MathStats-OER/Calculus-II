\section*{\topic\; Introduction:}

Our objective is to study the basics of {\bf\emph{infinite sequences}} and {\bf\emph{infinite series}}. So to get started, what is an infinite sequence?

\section*{Sequence Examples:}

\begin{example}

Consider the sequence $\{a_n\}$ where $a_n=2^n$ for natural numbers $n$. 
\[\big\{2^n\big\}_{n\in\N}=\big\{2,4,8,16,32,\dots\big\}\]
Notice that we will use curly set brackets for sequence notation. And as above we can describe a sequence either by some explicit rule, or by listing enough of the sequence elements to understand the pattern (if there is indeed a pattern). Here is a graph of the sequence.

\end{minipage}

\end{example}

\vfill\eject


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Here is another example.
\vskip 5mm

\begin{example} The Fibonnaci sequence is one of the most famous sequences in all of mathematics. This is defined recursively as follows.
\[a_{n}=a_{n-1}+a_{n-2},\quad\text{where }a_0=a_1=1\]
Notice that the sequence is not defined as an explicit formula involving $n$. That is, we are not given a rule $a_n=f(n)$. Rather, the $n^{th}$ term in the sequence is determined by the previous two terms. Here is the sequence.
\[\big\{1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,\dots\big\}\]


\end{example}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\vskip 5mm
Here is another simpler example.
\vskip 5mm

\begin{example} Define a sequence as follows so that $a_n=\ds\frac{n}{n^2+1}$.
\[\big\{a_n\big\}_{n\in\N}=\left\{\ds\frac{1}{2},\ds\frac{2}{5},\ds\frac{3}{10},\ds\frac{4}{17},\dots\right\}\]


\end{example}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\vskip 5mm
Here is another example.
\vskip 5mm

\begin{example} Here is is one of the most important sequences in all of mathematics. Let $k$ be any real number and define
\[a_n=\left(1+\ds\frac{k}{n}\right)^n\]
So we have
\[\big\{a_n\big\}^{\infty}_{n=1}=\left\{1+k, \left(1+\ds\frac{k}{2}\right)^2, \left(1+\ds\frac{k}{3}\right)^3,\left(1+\ds\frac{k}{4}\right)^4,\dots\right\}\]

\end{example}

\section*{Limiting Values of Sequences:}

The main question we will ask about sequences is whether of not the sequence converges to some value or diverges.
\vskip 5mm
\begin{minipage}[]{6.5in}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.7]{sequence_converge_def1.jpg}
%\captionof{figure}{}
\label{fig:}
\end{center}
\end{minipage}
\vskip 5mm
There is a nice graphic that reflects this idea.
\vskip 5mm
\begin{minipage}[]{6.5in}
\begin{center}

\captionof{figure}{Graphic Representation of a Sequence $\{a_n\}$ Converging to $L$.}
\label{fig:}
\end{center}
\end{minipage}
\vskip 5mm
The above definition is a somewhat informal definition that we will use in this class. However, we should realize that this definition can be formalized to be perfectly precise as follows.
\vskip 5mm
\begin{minipage}[]{6.5in}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.7]{sequence_converge_def2.jpg}
%\captionof{figure}{}
\label{fig:}
\end{center}
\end{minipage}
\vskip 5mm
We will not be working with this formal definition in this class. So how will we determine if a sequence converges or diverges? We will be exclusively evaluating explicit sequences and the following theorem will be our main tool for determining convergence or divergence.
\vskip 5mm
\begin{minipage}[]{6.5in}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.7]{sequence_converge_thm1.jpg}
%\captionof{figure}{}
\label{fig:}
\end{center}
\end{minipage}

This theorem tells us that we can use all of our previous knowledge of function limits to evaluate sequence limits.

\begin{example} Determine if the sequence $\{a_n\}$, where $a_n=n/(n^2+1)$, converges or diverges.
\vskip 5mm
\noindent{\bf\emph{\underline{Workspace}:}}

\vfill\eject

\ifnum\longform=1
	\begin{boxsolution}
\vspace*{5mm}
We see that $a_n=f(n)$ for the function $f(x)=x/(x^2+1)$. Then our knowledge of growth rates tells us that
\[\ds\lim_{x\to\infty}f(x)=\ds\lim_{x\to\infty}\ds\frac{x}{x^2+1}=0.\]
Therefore, the sequence $\{a_n\}$ converges to zero.
\vskip 5mm
Alternatively we could apply L'Hopital's rule.
\beq
\ds\lim_{x\to\infty}\ds\frac{x}{x^2+1}&=&\ds\frac{\infty}{\infty}\quad\text{form}\\
\\
&\downarrow&\text{by L'Hopital's Rule}\\
\\
\ds\lim_{x\to\infty}\ds\frac{x}{x^2+1}&=&\ds\lim_{x\to\infty}\ds\frac{1}{2x}=\ds\frac{1}{\infty}\quad\text{form}
\eeq
So $\ds\lim_{n\to\infty}a_n=\ds\lim_{n\to\infty}\ds\frac{n}{n^2+1}=0$.
\vspace*{5mm}
	\end{boxsolution}
\vskip 5mm

\end{example}

Let's consider another example.
\vskip 5mm

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{example} Determine if the sequence $\{a_n\}$, where $a_n=2n^3/(5n^3-n^2+1)$, converges or diverges.
\vskip 5mm
\noindent{\bf\emph{\underline{Workspace}:}}

\vfill\eject

\ifnum\longform=1
	\begin{boxsolution}
\vspace*{5mm}
We see that $a_n=f(n)$ for the function $f(x)=2x^3/(5x^3-x^2+1)$. Then our knowledge of growth rates tells us that
\[\ds\lim_{x\to\infty}f(x)=\ds\lim_{x\to\infty}\ds\frac{x}{x^2+1}=\ds\frac{2}{5}.\]
Therefore, the sequence $\{a_n\}$ converges to $2/5$.
\vskip 5mm
Alternatively we could apply algebraic techniques.
\beq
\ds\lim_{x\to\infty}\ds\frac{2x^3}{5x^3-x^2+1}&=&\ds\lim_{x\to\infty}\,\ds\frac{x^3}{x^3}\cdot\left(\ds\frac{2}{5-\ds\frac{1}{x}+\ds\frac{1}{x^3}}\right)\\
&=&\ds\lim_{x\to\infty}\ds\frac{2}{5-\ds\frac{1}{x}+\ds\frac{1}{x^3}}\\
&=&\ds\frac{2}{5-0+0}\\
\\
&=&\ds\frac{2}{5}
\eeq
So $\ds\lim_{n\to\infty}a_n=\ds\lim_{n\to\infty}\ds\frac{2n^3}{5n^3-n^2+1}=\ds\frac{2}{5}$.
\vspace*{5mm}
	\end{boxsolution}
\vskip 5mm

\end{example}

\vskip 5mm
Let's try another example.
\vskip 5mm

\begin{example} Determine if the sequence $\{a_n\}^{\infty}_{n=1}$, where $a_n=7n/\ln(n+1)$, converges or diverges.
\vskip 5mm
\noindent{\bf\emph{\underline{Workspace}:}}

\vfill\eject

\ifnum\longform=1
	\begin{boxsolution}
\vspace*{5mm}
We see that $a_n=f(n)$ for the function $f(x)=7x/\ln(x+1)$. Then our knowledge of growth rates tells us that
\[\ds\lim_{x\to\infty}f(x)=\ds\lim_{x\to\infty}\ds\frac{7x}{\ln(x+1)}=\infty.\]
So the sequence $\{a_n\}$ diverges to $\infty$.
\vskip 5mm
Alternatively we could apply L'Hopital's rule.
\beq
\ds\lim_{x\to\infty}\ds\frac{7x}{\ln(x+1)}&=&\ds\frac{\infty}{\infty}\quad\text{form}\\
\\
&\downarrow&\text{by L'Hopital's Rule}\\
\\
\ds\lim_{x\to\infty}7(x+1)&=&\infty
\eeq
So $\ds\lim_{n\to\infty}a_n=\ds\lim_{n\to\infty}\ds\frac{7n}{\ln(n+1)}=\infty$ and the sequence diverges.
\vspace*{5mm}
	\end{boxsolution}
\vskip 5mm

\fi

\end{example}

Let's try another extremely important example.
\vskip 5mm

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{example} Determine if the sequence $\{a_n\}^{\infty}_{n=1}$, where $a_n=\left(1+\ds\frac{k}{n}\right)^n$, converges or diverges.
\vskip 5mm
\noindent{\bf\emph{\underline{Workspace}:}}

\vfill\eject

\ifnum\longform=1
	\begin{boxsolution}
\vspace*{5mm}
We see that $a_n=f(n)$ for the function $f(x)=\left(1+\ds\frac{k}{x}\right)^x$. Then our knowledge of limits from Calculus I tells us that
\[\ds\lim_{x\to\infty}f(x)=\ds\lim_{x\to\infty}\left(1+\ds\frac{k}{x}\right)^x=e^k.\]
So the sequence $\{a_n\}$ converges to the exponential $e^k$.
\vskip 5mm
Alternatively we could apply L'Hopital's rule to verify the above limit, but from this point on we will define
\[\ds\lim\left(1+\ds\frac{k}{n}\right)^n:=e^k.\]
\vspace*{5mm}
	\end{boxsolution}
\vskip 5mm

\fi

\end{example}
\vskip 5mm

And now one more example that will be important for us in this course.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\vskip 5mm

\begin{example} Determine if the sequence $\{a_n\}^{\infty}_{n=1}$, where $a_n=cr^n$ for some real numbers $r$ and $c$, converges or diverges. This sequence is called a {\bf\emph{geometric sequence}}.
\vskip 5mm
\noindent{\bf\emph{\underline{Workspace}:}}

\vfill\eject

\ifnum\longform=1
	\begin{boxsolution}
\vspace*{5mm}
The sequence is listed as
\[\{a_n\}^{\infty}_{n=0}=\big\{c,cr,cr^2,cr^3,cr^4,\dots\big\}.\]
The defining property of this sequence is the common ration between consecutive terms.

\[\dots,cr^{k-1},\underbrace{cr^k,cr^{k+1}}_{a_{k+1}=ra_{k}},\dots\]
The limiting value of this sequence depends on the value of $r$.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item[$\bullet$] If $-1<r<1$, then $\ds\lim_{k\to\infty}a_k=\ds\lim_{k\to\infty}cr^k=0$.
		\item[$\bullet$] If $r=1$, then $\ds\lim_{k\to\infty}a_k=\ds\lim_{k\to\infty}c1^k=c$.
		\item[$\bullet$] If $r>1$, then $\ds\lim_{k\to\infty}a_k=\ds\lim_{k\to\infty}cr^k=\infty$.
		\item[$\bullet$] If $r\le -1$, then $\ds\lim_{k\to\infty}a_k=\ds\lim_{k\to\infty}cr^k$ does not exist.

\begin{figure}[h!]

\end{figure} 

We then have the following result about convergence of monotone sequences.

A proof of the theorem would require theoretical tools beyond the scope of this class. But the following diagram helps to understand why the theorem should be true.

The theorem means if we can show a sequence is bounded and either increasing or decreasing, then we can conclude the sequence converges. But the theorem does not tell us about the actual limiting value of the sequence. It just states that a limit exists.

\section*{Infinite Series:}

Next we will be studying {\bf\emph{infinite series}}. So what is an infinite series? It is simply a non-terminating discrete sum. We can think of it as an infinite sum of the terms in an infinite sequence.

\section*{Infinite Series Examples:}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{example} Determine if the following infinite series converges.
\[\ds\frac{3}{10}+\ds\frac{3}{100}+\ds\frac{3}{1000}+\ds\frac{3}{10000}+\cdots\]

\ifnum\longform=1
	\begin{boxsolution}
\vspace*{5mm}
Recognizing this series as corresponding to the decimal expansion of $1/3$ we can see that the series will converge to $1/3$. But let's be more formal and use the given definition.
\[s_k=\ds\frac{3}{10}+\ds\frac{3}{10^2}+\ds\frac{3}{10^3}+\cdots+\ds\frac{3}{10^k}.\]
Multiplying both sides by $1/10$ we have
\[s_k/10=\ds\frac{3}{10^2}+\ds\frac{3}{10^3}+\ds\frac{3}{10^4}+\cdots+\ds\frac{3}{10^{k+1}}.\]
It follows that
\[s_k-\ds\frac{s_k}{10}=\ds\frac{9s_k}{10}=\ds\frac{3}{10}-\ds\frac{3}{10^{k+1}}\quad\Longrightarrow\quad s_k=\ds\frac{10}{9}\left(\ds\frac{3}{10}-\ds\frac{3}{10^{k+1}}\right)=\ds\frac{1}{3}-\ds\frac{1}{3\cdot 10^k}.\]
To keep things as concrete as possible let's see what this means. If we have added $k=5$ terms then the $5^{th}$ partial sum is
\[s_5=\ds\frac{1}{3}-\ds\frac{1}{3\cdot 10^5}=0.33333.\]
If we have added $k=10$ terms then the $10^{th}$ partial sum is
\[s_{10}=\ds\frac{1}{3}-\ds\frac{1}{3\cdot 10^{10}}=0.3333333333.\]
If we have added $k=100$ terms then the $100^{th}$ partial sum is
\[s_{100}=\ds\frac{1}{3}-\ds\frac{1}{3\cdot 10^{100}}=0.\underbrace{33333\dots 3333}_{\text{One Hundred 3's}}.\]
It should be clear that as we add more and more terms we are getting arbitrarily close to the value $1/3$.
\vskip 5mm
More formally,
\[\ds\lim_{k\to\infty}s_k=\ds\lim_{k\to\infty}\ds\frac{1}{3}-\ds\frac{1}{3\cdot 10^k}=\ds\frac{1}{3}-0=\ds\frac{1}{3}.\] 
So the infinite series converges to $s=1/3$.
\vspace*{5mm}
	\end{boxsolution}
\vskip 5mm

\end{example}

This example is a specific case of what's known as a geometric series. Let's consider the general case for a geometric series (one of the most important sequences).
\vskip 5mm


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


\begin{example} Determine if the following infinite series converges.
\[\ds\sum^{\infty}_{n=0}cr^n=c+cr+cr^2+cr^3+cr^4+\cdots\] 
\vskip 5mm
\noindent{\bf\emph{\underline{Workspace}:}}

\vfill\eject

\ifnum\longform=1
	\begin{boxsolution}
\vspace*{5mm}
Let's be very careful and use the formal definition.
\[s_k=c+cr+cr^2+cr^3+cr^4+\cdots+ cr^k.\]
Multiplying both sides by $1/10$ we have
\[rs_k=cr+cr^2+cr^3+cr^4+\cdots+cr^{k+1}.\]
It follows that
\[s_k-\ds\frac{s_k}{10}=(1-r)s_k=c-cr^{k+1}\quad\Longrightarrow\quad s_k=c\left(\ds\frac{1-r^{k+1}}{1-r}\right).\]
Now formally,
\[\ds\lim_{k\to\infty}s_k=\ds\lim_{k\to\infty}c\left(\ds\frac{1-r^{k+1}}{1-r}\right)=c\left(\ds\frac{1}{1-r}\right) \quad\text{if}\quad -1<r<1.\] 
Otherwise the limit does not exist. So the geometric series converges to $s=\ds\frac{c}{1-r}$ only when $|r|<1$. In this case, we write
\[\ds\sum^{\infty}_{n=0}cr^k=\ds\frac{c}{1-r}.\] 
Otherwise, the series diverges. This is a fact that should be memorized from this point onwards.

Let's try another important example.

\begin{example}  Determine if the infinite series $\ds\sum^{\infty}_{n=1}\ds\frac{1}{n}$ converges or diverges.

Let's group terms of the sum as follows.
\[\ds\sum^{\infty}_{n=1}\ds\frac{1}{n}=1+\ds\frac{1}{2}+\underbrace{\ds\frac{1}{3}+\ds\frac{1}{4}}_{\ge 1/2}+\underbrace{\ds\frac{1}{5}+\cdots+\ds\frac{1}{8}}_{\ge 1/2}+\underbrace{\ds\frac{1}{9}+\cdots+\ds\frac{1}{16}}_{\ge 1/2}+\underbrace{\ds\frac{1}{17}+\cdots+\ds\frac{1}{32}}_{\ge 1/2}+\cdots\]
It is easy to see that the sequence of partial sums $\big\{s_k\big\}$ is increasing and not bounded above. Therefore we have
\[\ds\lim_{k\to\infty}s_k=\infty\]
and the infinite series diverges to $\infty$.
\vspace*{5mm}
	\end{boxsolution}
\vskip 5mm

\end{example}

\ifnum\longform=1
\vskip 5mm
	\begin{discussion}
\vspace*{5mm}
We will discover that for most infinite series it may be practically impossible to discover a formula for the $k^{th}$ partial sum. So we will need to spend a good deal of time developing tests for convergence and divergence of infinite series that don't require knowledge of any formula for the partial sums. This content will occupy a good deal of time in the next part of the course. See you there.
