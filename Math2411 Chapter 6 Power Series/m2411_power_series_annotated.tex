\section*{\topic\, Introduction:}

Our objective is to study a class of infinite series called {\bf\emph{power series}}.

\noindent{\bf\emph{\underline{Question}:}} What do you notice that is different about a power series compared to the series we have previously studied?
\vskip 2in

\noindent{\bf\emph{\underline{Answer}:}} The terms of a power series contain a variable quantity $x$ and so can be thought of as functions $f(x)$. One of the most important questions we ask about a function $f$ is the following: ``What is the domain of $f$?" In other words, what are the $x$-values where our function $f(x)$ is defined (or makes sense)? Since we are dealing with an infinite series we could pose this question as follows: For which $x$-values does the power series converge? We can summarize the answer to this question with the following theorem.

Look at the following diagram to get a better sense of the statement of the theorem.

Let's work some examples and discover the process.

\section*{Power Series Examples:}

\vskip 5mm
\begin{example} Find the interval of convergence and the radius of convergence for the power series
\[\ds\sum^{\infty}_{n=0}\ds\frac{x^n}{n!}.\]
\vskip 5mm
\noindent{\bf\emph{\underline{Workspace}:}}

\vfill\eject

\ifnum\longform=1
	\begin{boxsolution}
\vspace*{5mm}
Observe that the power series is centered at $a=0$. We will use the Ratio Test and so compute
\beq
r&=&\ds\lim_{n\to\infty}\left|\ds\frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n}\right|\\
\\
&=&\ds\lim_{n\to\infty}\left|\ds\frac{x^{n+1}}{(n+1)!}\cdot\ds\frac{n!}{x^n}\right|\\
\\
&=&\ds\lim_{n\to\infty}\left|\ds\frac{x}{n+1}\right|\\
\\
&=&|x|\ds\lim_{n\to\infty}\ds\frac{1}{n+1}\\
\\
&=&0<1\quad\text{for all }x\text{-values}.
\eeq
So the power series converges for all $x\in\R$ and the interval of convergence is $(-\infty,\infty)$ and radius of convergence is $R=\infty$.

Let's try another example.

\vskip 5mm
\begin{example} Find the interval of convergence and the radius of convergence for the power series
\[\ds\sum^{\infty}_{n=0}\ds\frac{(x-2)^n}{(n+1)3^n}.\]
\vskip 5mm
\noindent{\bf\emph{\underline{Workspace}:}}

\ifnum\longform=1
\noindent{\bf\emph{\underline{Workspace Continued}:}}

\vfill\eject

\fi

\ifnum\longform=1
	\begin{boxsolution}
Observe that the power series is centered at $a=2$. We will use the Ratio Test and so compute
\beq
r&=&\ds\lim_{n\to\infty}\left|\ds\frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n}\right|\\
\\
&=&\ds\lim_{n\to\infty}\left|\ds\frac{(x-2)^{n+1}}{(n+2)3^{n+1}}\cdot\ds\frac{(n+1)3^n}{(x-2)^n}\right|\\
\\
&=&\ds\lim_{n\to\infty}\left|\ds\frac{(x-2)(n+1)}{3(n+2)}\right|\\
\\
&=&|x-2|\ds\lim_{n\to\infty}\ds\frac{n+1}{3(n+2)}\\
\\
&=&\ds\frac{1}{3}\cdot|x-2|
\eeq
So we solve $r=\frac{1}{3}|x-2|<1$ for $x$.
\[\frac{1}{3}\cdot|x-2|<1\quad\iff\quad\underbrace{|x-2|<3}_{\textcolor{red}{R=3}}\quad\iff\quad-3<x-2<3\quad\iff\quad -1<x<5\]
So we see that the radius of convergence is $R=3$ and by the Ratio Test the power series converges absolutely when $-1<x<5$ and diverges when $x<-1$ and when $x>5$. However, the Ratio Test fails at $x=-1$ and $x=5$ because at those points we have $r=1$. So we must check for convergence at those endpoint $x$-values using some other convergence test.
\vskip 5mm

	\begin{enumerate}
		\item[$\bullet$] $x=-1$: We have the series $\ds\sum^{\infty}_{n=0}\ds\frac{(-3)^n}{(n+1)3^n}=\ds\sum^{\infty}_{n=1}(-1)^{n+1}\ds\frac{1}{n}$ which is the convergent alternating Harmonic Series. The original power series converges at $x=-1$.
\vskip 5mm
		\item[$\bullet$] $x=5$: We have the series $\ds\sum^{\infty}_{n=0}\ds\frac{3^n}{(n+1)3^n}=\ds\sum^{\infty}_{n=1}\ds\frac{1}{n}$ which is the divergent Harmonic Series. The original power series diverges at $x=5$.
		
	\end{enumerate}

So we have the interval of convergence is $[-1,5)$. Observe that the center of the interval is $a=2$.

\begin{example} Find the interval of convergence and the radius of convergence for the power series
\[\ds\sum^{\infty}_{n=0}\ds\frac{x^{2n+2}}{4^{n+1}}.\]

\noindent{\bf\emph{\underline{Workspace}:}}

\vfill\eject

\ifnum\longform=1
	\begin{boxsolution}
Observe that the power series is centered at $a=0$. We will use the Ratio Test and so compute
\beq
r&=&\ds\lim_{n\to\infty}\left|\ds\frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n}\right|\\
\\
&=&\ds\lim_{n\to\infty}\left|\ds\frac{x^{2n+4}}{4^{n+2}}\cdot\ds\frac{4^{n+1}}{x^{2n+2}}\right|\\
\\
&=&\ds\lim_{n\to\infty}\left|\ds\frac{x^2}{4}\right|\\
\\
&=&\ds\frac{x^2}{4}\\
\eeq
So we solve $r=x^2/4<1$ for $x$.
\[\frac{x^2}{4}<1\quad\iff\quad x^2<4\quad\iff\quad\underbrace{|x|<2}_{\textcolor{red}{R=2}}\quad\iff\quad -2<x<2\]
So we see that the radius of convergence is $R=2$ and by the Ratio Test the power series converges absolutely when $-2<x<2$ and diverges when $x<-2$ and when $x>2$. However, the Ratio Test fails at $x=-2$ and $x=2$ because at those points we have $r=1$. So we must check for convergence at those endpoint $x$-values using some other convergence test.
\vskip 5mm

	\begin{enumerate}
		\item[$\bullet$] $x=-2$: We have the series $\ds\sum^{\infty}_{n=0}\ds\frac{(-2)^{2n+2}}{4^{n+1}}=\ds\sum^{\infty}_{n=0}1$ which is a divergent series. The original power series diverges at $x=-2$.
\vskip 5mm
		\item[$\bullet$] $x=2$: We have the series $\ds\sum^{\infty}_{n=0}\ds\frac{2^{2n+2}}{4^{n+1}}=\ds\sum^{\infty}_{n=0}1$ which is a divergent series. The original power series diverges at $x=2$.
		
	\end{enumerate}

So we have the interval of convergence is $(-2,2)$. Observe that the center of the interval is $a=0$.

\\

\\
&=&\ds\frac{|x+1|}{e}\ds\lim_{n\to\infty}\ds\frac{n+1}{n}\\
\\
&=&\ds\frac{|x+1|}{e}\\
\eeq
So we solve $r=|x+1|/e<1$ for $x$.
\[\frac{|x+1|}{e}<1\quad\iff\quad\underbrace{|x+1|<e}_{\textcolor{red}{R=e}}\quad\iff\quad -e<x+1<e\quad\iff\quad -1-e<x<-1+e\]
So we see that the radius of convergence is $R=e$ and by the Ratio Test the power series converges absolutely when $-1-e<x<-1+e$ and diverges when $x<-1-e$ and when $x>-1+e$. However, the Ratio Test fails at $x=-1-e$ and $x=-1+e$ because at those points we have $r=1$. So we must check for convergence at those endpoint $x$-values using some other convergence test.
\vskip 5mm

	\begin{enumerate}
		\item[$\bullet$] $x=-1-e$: We have the series $\ds\sum^{\infty}_{n=0}\ds\frac{n\big(-e\,\big)^{n}}{e^n}=\ds\sum^{\infty}_{n=0}(-1)^n\cdot n$ which is a divergent series. The original power series diverges at $x=-1-e$.
\vskip 5mm
		\item[$\bullet$] $x=-1+e$: We have the series $\ds\sum^{\infty}_{n=0}\ds\frac{ne^n}{e^n}=\ds\sum^{\infty}_{n=0}n$ which is a divergent series. The original power series diverges at $x=-1+e$.
		
	\end{enumerate}
\vskip 5mm
So we have the interval of convergence is $(-1-e,-1+e)$. Observe that the center of the interval is $a=-1$.
